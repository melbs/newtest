    <shortdesc>Apply settings to groups of users or devices </shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Initially in your Google Admin console, all your users and devices are placed in a single
            organizational unit, called the top-level organizational unit. All settings you make in
            the Admin console apply to this top-level organizational unit and, therefore, to all
            users and devices in your account. </p>
        <p>To apply different settings to some users or devices, place them in a child
            organizational unit, (for example, Finance, Human Resources) below the top level. Users
            or devices in organizational units get the settings that you apply to them. To keep a
            child organizational unit from inheriting its parentâ€™s settings, apply to the child any
            settings that are specific to it. </p>
